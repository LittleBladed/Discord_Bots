# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Roan, a.k.a. LittleBladed, I'm an excited college student who loves to code and develop things in my spare time. My goal is to eventually be a full time developer and more importantly make people happy!

## Current bots:

### Little Bot:
My first real project, one I hold close to my heart to this day (as long as I don't look at the code for too long)
It's the first bot that really got me started with bot developing, and I'm happy it did. This bot was my pride for a long time, and I was constantly thinking of new things to add to it. 

### LenderAPIBot:
A very very small bot with the singular use of checking if a steam account is family shared

### TI Bot:
A bot for my school discord server, verifies if students are in fact members of our school by sending them an email

### Anonimail:
A bot that can do role reactions + ask anonymous questions to the rest of the server

### Ticket Bot:
A pretty advanced ticket bot with configurable questions, including tailored questions. 
Suggestions with configurable questions, some staff commands and join to create voice channels.
